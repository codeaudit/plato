This helps to catch shape-errors at compile-time instead of run-time, where it is difficult to find the line of code that caused them.  However, it can be a bit of extra work for the programmer, because they have to manually attach test values to their variables.  Fortunately, since Plato compiles your functions on the first pass, it can attach test-values \"under the hood\".\n",

Since all inputs are given test values, we can easily track down the error - the traceback will lead back to the correct line.  This would not have been possible without test values, because the error would occur in the compiled code, which is no-longer linked to the source code."
