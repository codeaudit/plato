"""
Takes all .py files in the directory, and, if they don't already have a
corresponding .ipynb file, creates them from the py files.  We do this because
we don't want to version-control .ipynb files (which can contain images and use
a special machine-readable format), but we do want to save their contents.

Solution: Start ipython notebook with the "--script" argument, which causese notebooks
to be automatically saved as .py files - these can be versioned.  Then when we run this
script, we regenerate all .pynb notebooks from the .py files.  The output of course will
not be preserved through this process.

This follows from a discussion here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18734739/using-ipython-notebooks-under-version-control

Call this script with argument "-ov" to overwrite existing .ipynb files.
